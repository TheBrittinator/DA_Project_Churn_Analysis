They would really appreciate if someone could analyze it for them, in order to understand the main reasons for leaving the services, and to come up with recommendations for how the bank can mitigate that. Eventually, the bank would like to proactively implement these recommendations in order to keep their customers happy.","metadata":{},"id":"002c3e9c-baa6-4804-86e6-1777aab23ae9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"**A full ERD can be found [here](https://dbdiagram.io/d/638cdd8abae3ed7c45449eed)**\n\n# Data Description\nIn this task, few datasets are provided:\n\n1. **`BankChurners.csv`**   - this file contains basic information about each client (10 columns).

creative with the way you build your dashboard and only gives guidance on the types of visualizations you should use.\n\nCreate a dashboard that will contain at least 5 out of the 8 requirements defined below:\n\n1. **At least 2 KPIs** as Big Ass Numbers. Choose the metrics on your own that will fit with the rest of your analysis. Examples of metrics:\n    - Total number of clients\n    - Churn rate %\n    - Average transaction amount per customer\n    - Average transaction amount before churn\n    - etc.\n2. **Churn rate %** among different **age groups**. You will need to:\n    - Use the Bins function to split client age into age ranges\n    - Define Churn rate % as a calculated field\n    - Choose the way of visualizing the comparison\n3. **A Scatterplot** visualizing certain customer spending behaviors and their connection to the churn if exists. For example, you can compare Total transaction amount and Total transaction count of each client and use color to mark churned and existing customers. \n4. **A Highlight Table** comparing Churn rate % among two demographic dimensions (from *basic_client_info* table), where one is placed on Rows and another on Columns, forming a matrix. \n5. **A Bar Chart** with multiple metrics by Clientnum, where each row represents one Client and has multiple metrics as columns. Add a few filters or parameters to let user drill down into the set of clients they are interested in.\n6. **A Pareto Analysis** based on custom defined **customer segment**. \n    - Segment can include values from the demographic information of the client. For example,\n        - Gender | Income\n        - Gender | Income | Marital status\n        - etc.\n    - Choose the metric to analyse. For example,\n        - Total number of clients (People from which customer segments most often become our clients?)\n        - Churn rate absolute (How many churned customers we have in each segment?)\n        - Churn rate % (What is the relative churn rate in each customer segment?)\n        - etc.\n7. **At least 1 parameter** that allows dashboard user to interact with the dashboard. For example,\n    - to change the metric used in the chart(s)\n    - to change the value of a benchmark\n8.
